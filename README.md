This is the starter code project for the `Demo 1` project in CMPM 121, Game Development Patterns, at UC Santa Cruz (fall quarter, 2024). Students should incrementally modify this project, tracking their progress with git, to develop an incremental game of their own unique design.

The project by Cheristic (https://github.com/Cheristic/cmpm-121-demo-1) inspired the addition of an animated GIF background.
The project by edmfong (https://github.com/edmfong/cmpm-121-demo-1/tree/main) inspired the redesign of the upgrade buttons to include the cost, amount, and description inside the buttons.
